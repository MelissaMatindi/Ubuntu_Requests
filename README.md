# Ubuntu Image Fetcher
A Python tool to download images from URLs, inspired by Ubuntu's philosophy: "I am because we are." It fetches images respectfully, handles errors gracefully, and organizes them for sharing.

## Features

- Accepts one or many image URLs (CLI, file, or interactive input)
- Validates HTTP headers and prevents dangerous downloads
- Streams images and saves them to `Fetched_Images/`
- Prevents duplicates by hashing content (SHA-256) and storing an index
- Handles errors gracefully â€” no crashes, clear messages
